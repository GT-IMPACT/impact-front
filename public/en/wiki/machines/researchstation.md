##### Description

The mechanism is needed to learn the recipes of high-tier items (usually, UHV+ tier).

##### General

The Data Stick must be placed in the controller of the research station. The item you need to research to get the recipe - in the Object Holder.

The Quantum Computer must provide the research station with the necessary amount of computation per second to study the prescription. If less computation than necessary, the research won`t start, if more, it will run faster. Energy Hatch level has no effect on the research speed.

The research station communicates with the quantum computer using Optical Fiber Cable. In the station the cable is connected to the data receiver (Optical Slave Connector), in the computer - to the data transmitter (Optical Master Connector). 1 transmitter can only be connected to 1 receiver. If several quantum computers are to be connected to the station, they can be connected in series by installing receivers in them.

For operation, the transmitter, receiver and the cable connecting them must be painted the same color. Fiber optic cables painted in different colors are not interconnected.

##### Important!

It is forbidden to dismantle a structure in working state to avoid an explosion!
