##### Description

The supercomputer allows parallels to be distributed to Impact machines.

##### General

— Needs a Space Satellite

— Needs a Communication Tower


The computer stores Parallel Point (PP), with the possibility of increasing or spending them. Points are needed to distribute parallels to machines, each machine is limited by the number of parallels: 4, 16, 64, 256.


What is parallelism? Parallelism is the ability to simultaneously perform the same type of action in several threads.


If we consider parallels in the game, then this is the execution of one type of recipe several times at one time (while the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes being executed).


The structure of the computer can change (in length), the maximum length is 16 blocks, the minimum is 2.

##### Principle of operation

After installing the communication tower, it is necessary to tune the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will worked. Are tuned through the laptop.


There is a Computer Rack to control the points of parallels. The Computer Rack has 4 slots that fit the Parallel CPU. There are 4 types of processors that produce: 4, 16, 64, 256 PP.


Parallel Transmitter is used to transmit parallelism. Parallel Transmitter there are 4 tiers that transmit: 4, 16, 64, 256 PP. When installing the transmitter, the computer will immediately reserve the required amount of PP for the transmitter to work.


To transfer the PP to the machine you need, you need to install the Parallel Receiver in it. Next, click on the Parallel Receiver using your laptop and then click on the Parallel Transmitter on your computer.

If the receiver / transmitter is lit red — there is a connection error or there is no connection, if it is lit yellow — a successful connection.

##### Important!

The power consumption of a computer is calculated using the following formula:

Consumption (EU/t) = 8192 + Max PP.

Max PP — the total amount of PP from the Parallel Processors installed in the computer.
