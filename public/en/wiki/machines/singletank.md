##### Description

The mechanism is needed to store 1 liquid in a huge volume.

##### General

It does not break down and does not require power. Input/Output Hatch is used for fluid input/output.

The amount of stored fluid depends on the level of the Tank Storage Block. 

The liquid stored in the tank can be locked by putting a capsule with this liquid into an empty slot in the controller.

Fluid disappears from the tank only when the controller or storage blocks are destroyed.

You can enable the Auto-voiding mode by clicking a screwdriver on the controller block.

To interface with the ME-network, you should install an I/O Tank Hatch and hang a fluid storage bus on it.

The priority of the tank in the ME-network can be adjusted by clicking Soldering Iron on the I/O Tank Hatch. With Shift-clicking -100 priority, without Shift +100.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
