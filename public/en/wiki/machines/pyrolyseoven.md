##### Description
The principle of operation of a pyrolysis oven is based on the thermal decomposition of organic substances into pyrolysis gases and solid residues.
##### General
The machine has a unique mechanics — product output during operation.
##### Principle of operation
During («Time») of the recipe, gases and solid fuels are released:
— At 7 seconds — Carbon Monoxide (72L)
— At 14 seconds — Hydrogen Gas (288L)
— At 21 seconds — Methane Gas (144L)
— At 28 seconds — CO2 Gas (216L)
— At 35 seconds — Wood Tar (1440L) and Charcoal (x5)
