##### Description

The mechanism is designed for pollution cleaning.

##### General

Cleans an area around itself measuring 3 by 3 chunks.

The degree of cleaning depends on the level of the Muffler Hatch. It is not possible to combine Muffler Hatch of different levels.

You can put Turbine Rotor in the controller, this will increase the cleaning. The increase depends on the size of the rotor and its material. The Rotor will eventually break down.

You can put an Adsorption Filter in the Input Bus, it increases the cleaning even more. Dirty filter returns after 1 cycle (10 seconds) to Output Bus, it can be cleaned afterwards.

##### Structure features

Blocks flanking the Air Filter Vent Casing and Muffler Hatch as well as the Air Filter Turbine Casing on top must be empty.

Maximum allowable Muffler Hatch = Energy Hatch level * 2

For example, with HV Energy Hatch (tier=3), the maximum Muffler Hatch level is LuV (tier=6).
