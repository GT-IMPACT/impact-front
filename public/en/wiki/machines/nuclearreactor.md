### NUCLEAR REACTOR

##### Description

There are 3 tiers of the reactor, they differ in structure and the amount of rods (1, 9 or 25). Designed for the generation of conventional / superheated steam and for the extraction of radioactive resources.

##### General

The nuclear reactor has 2 modes of operation, Default Mode and Fast Decay Mode. Each mode includes 2 types of fuel: regular rods and MOX rods.

##### Default Mode

Regular rods generate steam. MOX rods generate superheated steam, but it is important that all the rods in the reactor are MOX, otherwise the regime will remain as with regular rods.

##### Fast Decay Mode

This mode allows the rapid decay of nuclear fuel. Fuel decay occurs 5 times faster than the Default mode. In this mode, the reactor consumes Coolant and produces Hot Coolant.

##### Reactor control

1. Current mode of the reactor.

2. Input / Output fluids.

3. MOX fuel indicator.

4. Temperature indicator.

5. Up the level of all rods completely.

6. Up / Down the level for all rods by 10%.

##### Rod control

1. Up / Down the level for all rods by 10%.

2. Fuel slot.

3. Rod level indicator.

4. If you visit the fuel, the duration of the fuel burning is subtracted in proportion to the level of the rod.
