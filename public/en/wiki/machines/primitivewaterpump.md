##### Description
Designed to generate water at the initial stages and in hard-to-reach places without power supply.
##### General
The machine generates water without electricity depending on the biome in which the controller is located.
##### Water generation coefficient
Water generation coefficient = h. The ratio is changed using Output Hatch:
— Pump Output Hatch: h = 1
— ULV Output Hatch: h = 2
— LV Output Hatch: h = 3
