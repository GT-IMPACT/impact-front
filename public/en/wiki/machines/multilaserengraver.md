##### Description

The machine is analog to Precision Laser Engraver. Can work with [parallelism](/wiki/mechanics#parallelism).

##### General

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

Can work with a lot of programmed circuits or lenses that are in different Input Buses. The recipe is executed with the circuit\lens that is in the same Input Bus as the materials.

##### Important!

Doesn't ignore the requirement 'Needs Cleanroom'.

##### Structure Features

The mechanism has geometric dimensions 5x3x5 length, width, height, respectively. The mandatory blocks in addition to the controller are Maintenance Hatch, Energy Hatch. You need 36 Engraver Casing, 10 I-glass (1 white, 3 red, 3 green, 3 blue) to build (not including hatchlings). The colors of the glass are fixed and cannot be changed.
