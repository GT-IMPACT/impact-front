##### Description

The mechanism is needed to store up to 25 liquids in a huge volume.

##### General

It does not break down and does not require power. Input/Output Hatch is used for fluid input/output.

The amount of stored fluid depends on the level of the Tank Storage Block. 

The liquid stored in the tank can be locked by putting a capsule with this liquid into an empty slot in the controller. If you want to lock many liquids, you should specify them all in the View Cell in the Cell Workbench and put this cell in an empty slot of the controller.

Fluid disappears from the tank only when the controller or storage blocks are destroyed.

You can enable the Auto-voiding mode by clicking a screwdriver on the controller block.

To interface with the ME-network, you should install an I/O Tank Hatch and connect a ME cable to it or hang a fluid storage bus on it.

The priority of the tank in the ME-network can be adjusted by clicking Soldering Iron on the I/O Tank Hatch. With Shift-clicking -100 priority, without Shift +100.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
