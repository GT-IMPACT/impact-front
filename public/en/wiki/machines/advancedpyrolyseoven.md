![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/AdvPyrolyse.png)
##### Description
The principle of operation of a pyrolysis oven is based on the thermal decomposition of organic substances into pyrolysis gases and solid residues.
##### General
The advanced Pyrolysis Oven differs from the conventional Pyrolysis Oven in that it is parallel (several recipes are executed at the same time).
##### Principle of operation
Principle of operation: During («Time») of the recipe, gases and solid fuels are released:
— At 7 seconds — Carbon Monoxide (72L)
— At 14 seconds — Hydrogen Gas (288L)
— At 21 seconds — Methane Gas (144L)
— At 28 seconds — CO2 Gas (216L)
— At 35 seconds — Wood Tar (1440L) and Charcoal (x5)
##### Important!
The machine, depending on the tier Energy Hatch, performs several recipes at a time (LV — 2x, MV — 4x, HV — 6x .. Tier * 2)
##### Energy consumption
EU / t = EU / t (prescription) * number of concurrent recipes * Energy Hatch tier / 2
