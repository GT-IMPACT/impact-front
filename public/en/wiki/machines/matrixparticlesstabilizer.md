##### Description

The machine is needed to stabilize the beam of unstable matrix particles. Requires low gravity.

##### General

The unstable particle beam from the Parametric Diffuser should enter the I-Glass on the left, the stable particle beam for the Matrix Particles Containment comes out on the right.

The distance to the Parametric Diffuser and Matrix Particles Containment should not exceed 30 blocks.


Can accumulate up to 100,000 stable particles. Produces 1,000 particles per second.


Beams and lightnings do no damage.

Constantly consumes 1,920 EU/t electricity.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
