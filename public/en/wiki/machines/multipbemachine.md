![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/ParBPE.png)

##### Description

The machine is analog to Extruder, Bender and Forming Press. Can work with [parallelism](/wiki/mechanics#parallelism).

##### General

It has three operating modes. Modes are switched with a screwdriver.

Can work with a lot of programmed circuits/ or Extruder shapes that are in different Input Buses in 'Bus separated on' mode (switched with a screwdriver while holding down the Shift key). The recipe is executed with the circuit/shape that is in the same Input Bus as the materials.

##### Mode 1. Extruder

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 2. Bender

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 3. Forming Press

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

Can automatically rename items with Mold (Name) renamed to that name, that will be given to the item (the shape can be renamed with Tool Forge without consuming a level). Works only if the bass with this form is not more than 1 stack of items.

##### Structure

The mechanism has geometric dimensions 5x3x3 length, width, height, respectively. The Muffler Hatch, Maintenance Hatch, and Energy Hatch are mandatory blocks in addition to the controller. Thus, without taking into account the input, output buses, Parallel Receiver, you need 41 PBE Casing blocks.
