![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/ParAssembler.png)

##### Description

The machine is analog to Assembler, Circuit Assembler and Component Assembler. Can work with [parallelism](/wiki/mechanics#parallelism).

##### General

It has three operating modes. Modes are switched with a screwdriver.

Can work with a lot of programmed circuits that are in different Input Buses in 'Bus separated on' mode (switched with a screwdriver while holding down the Shift key). The recipe is executed with the circuit that is in the same Input Bus as the materials.

##### Mode 1. Assembler

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 2. Circuit Assembler

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 3. Component Assembler

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Important!

Doesn't ignore the requirement 'Needs Cleanroom'.

##### Structure Features

The mechanism has geometric dimensions 3x9x3 length, width, height, respectively. The mandatory blocks in addition to the controller are Maintenance Hatch, Energy Hatch. Thus, without taking into account the input and output buses, Parallel Receiver to build a 59 Assembler Casing, 9 I-Glass of any color.
